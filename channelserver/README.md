# Simple websocket pairsona server

## Config options:

Options can be set as ENV vars (prefixed with "`PAIR_`", e.g.
"`PAIR_PORT="8000"`"), or as arguments ("`--port=8000`").

See `src/settings.rs` for defaults.

## GeoIP lookup
This product includes GeoLite2 data created by MaxMind, available from
[https://www.maxmind.com](https://www.maxmind.com).

This will require a [maxmind GeoIP](https://dev.maxmind.com/geoip/geoip2/geolite2/) lookup database. This presumes that
the database will be in `mmdb/latest/GeoLite2-City.mmdb`. Use the
`mmdb_loc` to specify a different path (*Note:* if running in the debugger,
you may need to create a symlink under `target/debug`.)

If desired the `fetch_mmdb.bash` script will fetch and install the
latest copy of the GeoLite2 db.

## Compile and run:

After installing rust via [rustup](https://rustup.rs/):

```sh
$ cargo run
```

## API

When connecting to the server as a new session, the first response
message contains the URI path to send to the counterpart client, This
is known as the "channel". Currently channels are limited by the
`max_clients` config option to 2 sessions.

This version of the server will echo data sent to a channel all other
sessions on a channel. This will change in later versions.
